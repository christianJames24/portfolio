				<h2>About!</h2>
				<p>This page is about web page designs that I like and web page desings that I don't like. If you don't agree with me then my advice to you is is to agree with me.</p>

				<h2>Web page designs that I like</h2>
				<div class="flexDiv">
					<div class="websiteLinks">
						<h3 class="colorDGreen">Sonic Frontiers</h3>
						<div>
							<a href="https://frontiers.sonicthehedgehog.com/" target="_blank">Link to site</a>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					
					<p>
						I like the layout for the new Sonic the Hedgehog game, Sonic Frontiers.<br><br>
						The header was what I really liked because it has all you need: <br><br>
						The name, and information about the game are on the left of the header and newsletter and purchase is on the right.<br>
						That way you'd know right away that there's a difference between those options before even reading them.
						<br><br>
						<img src="Images/sonic1.png" alt="webworks1" style="width:75%; height:auto;">
						<br><br>
						The rest of the page is also great because it only gives you the information you need and isn't overloading you. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexDiv">
					<div class="websiteLinks">
						<h3 class="colorDGreen">Thomas & Friends Engines</h3>
						<div>
							<a href="https://play.thomasandfriends.com/en-ca/engines" target="_blank">Link to site</a>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The Thomas & Friends Engines page is very good.<br><br>
						Other than it being very very cluthered, It does its job really good, which is only displaying all the engines.<br>
						It's really cool that when you size the window to big or small, all the images change in a way to fit the whole page the best way possible. <br><br>
						<img src="Images/thomas1.jpg" alt="webworks1" style="width:75%; height:auto;"><br><br>
						There is very little text and information about the characters though, but if you're just looking for an engine from the show, then you probably don't need anything.
					</p>

				<h2>Web page designs that I don't like</h2>
				<div class="flexDiv">
					<div class="websiteLinks">
						<h3 class="colorDGreen">Webworks</h3>
						<div>
							<a href="https://webwork.champlainww.ca/" target="_blank">Link to site</a>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						I don't like the design of the webworks website.<br><br>
						My main problem with the website is how all the classes are just dumped into a compact list. It makes it a bit annoying when you want to find your class for the first time.
						<br><br>
						<img src="Images/webworks1.png" alt="webworks1" style="width:75%; height:auto;">
						<br><br>
						I am nitpicking, but I don't like the navigation system. It doesn't work well. I usually have to click on a few extra links to get to the page I want because all the pages look the same with the same exact looking blue buttons near the same positions everywhere.
